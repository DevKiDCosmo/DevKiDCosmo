### Hi there 👋 I'm DevKiD

I'm a Dev. The big project that I'm developing is Cosmo Universe. It is a programming language that perform calculation, graphics and more in under millisecond. The hard part about the project is, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. I bring the compile time up to 3 mm. That is not fast enough. Please humans and devs. Help me.

> _<I will release the first version of Cosmolang Arch... in 2024 oder earlier.>_

## The current projects I work:
- **Cosmo Universe** *BIG PROJECT* :octocat: 🥇
- * Cosmolang 🦄

- **DRC-Express** NANO PROJECT

-  **MATH EXPRESSION CALCULATION**

## A short story about me:
I start developing in my 8th year. I started with Java, then C, then C++... (A very long list).
I can speak 9 languages (German, Vietnamese, English, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Latin, French and Spanish). I can program in over 50 programming languages. My life is boring and I like programming and eating. I also like code and was in quarantine for 2 years. BLA BLA BLA. It is now 2023. Many people say that I am intelligent. I have an actual IQ of 134. On the other hand, my memory is good at remembering names in class. I am very young, but I think I'm very old. The text is tooooooooooo long. My soul looks like this: 🖤. AND DONE. Don't read any further. AND I'm a BOY. That is all you know.

> We are all young. <sup>*(I'm 12 at 2023)*</sup>
