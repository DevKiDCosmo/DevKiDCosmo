### Hi there 👋 I'm DevKiD

I'm a Dev. The big project that I'm developing is Cosmo Universe. It is a programming language that perform calculation, graphics and more in under millisecond. I bring the compile time up to 3 mm. That is not fast enough. Please devs. Help me. The reposity is: https://github.com/DevKiDMediaCreation/cosmolangarchitecture-CosArch

Programming language/Frameworks that I can/use:

C/C++; F#; C#; Flutter/Bart; Swift; PHP; Markdown; TS/JS; HTML/CSS; Cosmolang; ASM; Bash; Rust; Shell; Java; Python; MySql/Sql; Scala; Kotlin; React; Vue.js

## The current projects I work:
- **Cosmo Universe** *BIG PROJECT* :octocat: 🥇
- * Cosmolang 🦄
- * Kraken Cosmolang 🐙
- * Indexing Programming Language Managment System (IPLMS). ***VERY IMPORTANT and very complex***
- * IPLMS -> IPL Legacy. I will create IPL and IPlA. (Better versions) 
- * Cosmolang Architecture Research Labs 🥼 (CARL/CosArch)

## A short story about me:
I start developing in my 8th year. I started with Java, then C, then C++... (A very long list).
I can speak 7 languages (German, Vietnamese, English, Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Latin). I can program in over 50 programming languages. My life is boring and I like programming and eating. I also like code and was in quarantine for 2 years. It is now 2025. That is all you need to know.
