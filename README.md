## A short story about me:
I start developing in my 8th year. I started with Java, then C, then C++... (A very long list).
I can speak 7 languages (German, Vietnamese, English, Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Latin). I can program in over 50 programming languages. My life is boring and I like programming and eating. I also like code and was in quarantine for 2 years. It is now 2025. That is all you need to know.
