### Hi there üëã I'm DevKiD

That is not fast enough. Please devs. Help me. The reposity is: https://github.com/DevKiDMediaCreation/cosmolangarchitecture-CosArch

Programming language/Frameworks that I can/use:
C/C++; F#; C#; Flutter/Bart; Objective C/C++; Swift; PHP; Markdown; TS/JS; HTML/CSS; Cosmolang; ASM; Bash; Rust; Shell; Java; Unity; Unreal Engine; GodotScript; Python; MySql/Sql; Scala; Kotlin; React; VCB Asm; Vue.js

## A short story about me:
I start developing in my 8th year. I started with Java, then C, then C++... (A very long list).
I can speak 7 languages (German, Vietnamese, English, Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Latin). I can program in over 50 programming languages. My life is boring and I like programming and eating. I also like code and was in quarantine for 2 years. It is now 2023. I'm a male. That is all you need ti know.
